Judas was not a traitor. Let that sink in. Judah was _not_ a traitor. In fact, he may have been the most audaciously faithful disciple in Jesus' chosen Twelve.

<!--excerpt-->
We spent a great deal of time during the semester discussing the idea that the Twelve hadn't ever fully understood Christ's mission before His death. That appeared to be true for all of the Twelve. Indeed, it would seem such was truefor many of the Jews.

If we operate under the assumption that the Jews (by which we mean the leading class) were obsessed with independence from Rome, we begin to see a lot of the New Testament differently. I think we are accustomed to this assumption, but that we only selectively apply it to where it conveniently helps us conclude what we already believe.

Coincidentally, this same concept of application to achiever preconditioned beliefs affected the Jews.
