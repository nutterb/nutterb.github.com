**For All Youth and Adults Interested in Participating in a Venture Crew**

For eight years, I was an assistant scoutmaster with [Troop 662](www.troop662.net) in the Cleveland, Ohio area.  In 2015, I moved to Richmond for a new job.  I've missed the adventures I had in the scout troop, but have been hesitant to join ranks with a local troop, as I only have daughters. Recently, I've decided it's time for me to go back to those adventures, but in a forum that will allow my daughters to participate with me when they are old enough. For this purpose, I am organizing Venture Crew 1779 in Richmond, KY.

### What is Venturing?

[Venturing](http://www.venturing.org/index.html) is the adventure program sponsored by the Boy Scouts of America for boys and girls age 14 - 20.  Venturing promotes the development of leadership skills by having the youth select, plan, organize, and execute activities of their choosing. 

### What can I expect in an Adventure?

Venture crews organize activities that fall into one of three tiers.

* **Tier 1** adventures are short, day-long excursions that may be a day-hike, a recruiting event, or presentations to other groups.
* **Tier 2** adventures are multi-day excursions that may take up to four days. These include camping, white water rafting, and fishing excursions, or whatever else the youth decide they want to do. They are usually physically challenging, but may also be leadership focused, such as organizing a multi-day youth camp to encourage fitness.
* **Tier 3** adventures are multi-day excursions that take more than four days. These may include backpacking trips, canoeing trips, or trips to established camps and high adventure bases.

### Why would I enjoy participating?

The primary motivation for joining a Venture Crew is that it is fun!

Venture Crews also have an achievement structure that encourages new challenges and adventures. Youth are encouraged to earn the [Core awards](http://www.venturing.org/core.html), which focus on having the youth organize and execute the adventures. Older and more experienced youth are encouraged to mentor younger youth into accomplishing these goals. In other words, the youth develop confidence, leadership, and independence under the supervision of trained and qualified adults.

Venturing offers additional awards that youth may elect to pursue, including awards for [community awareness and involvement](http://www.venturing.org/trust-award.html), [physical fitness](http://www.venturing.org/quest-award.html), and [STEM](http://www.venturing.org/nova-award.html).

### When do we start?

The first meeting will occur on 10 August, 2017 at the LDS Church, 201 South Keenland Rd, Richmond, KY (note: this will be a _non-denominational_ crew. There is no requirement for religious participation in any particular denomination, or any denomination at all). Will will meet at 6:30 PM.

Meetings will initially occur every second and fourth Thursday of each month. I am considering making the meetings available via conference call. Please let me know if this is an options that improves your potential to participate.

Our initial goals to get started will be for the youth to establish a vision, mission, and code-of-conduct for Crew participants. After that, we will begin planning adventures and fund-raising.

### How much will this cost my family?

Basic registration for the Crew is $24 per year.  Each adventure trip will include a nominal fee to cover the cost of food. This will permit fundraising efforts to be dedicated to purchasing gear (tents, stoves, cooksets, etc.). 

Youth may want to look into acquiring their own outdoor gear over time. Sturdy boots are a good start.
