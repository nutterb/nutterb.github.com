Our\ngreatest sources of joy are our two daughters who fill our home with\nlaughter, giggles, Legos, and stuffed animals.\n\nStatistician\n------------\n\nI became fascinated with statistical analysis while attending the\nUniversity of Southern Maine. I pursued a career in statistics at the\nCleveland Clinic and eventually moved to Richmond, Kentucky to support\nthe mission of the Bluegrass Chemical Agent destruction Pilot Plant\n(BGCAPP). I am fortunate to do work that I love every day designing\nstudies, performing analyses, and developing reproducible programming\nsolutions for operational support.\n\nProgramming Hobbyist\n--------------------\n\nProgramming in R has been a way for me to explore new solutions to\nproblems I encounter in my work. It has also helped me develop greater\nknowledge of statistical concepts and communication methods.\n\nIn time, I hope to become fluent in C\\# in order to leverage the\nstrengths of R, C\\#, and SQL Server products.\n",
