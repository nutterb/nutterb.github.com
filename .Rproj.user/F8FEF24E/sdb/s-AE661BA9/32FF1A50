Our greatest sources of joy are our two daughters who fill our home with laughter, giggles, Legos, and stuffed animals.\n\n## Statistician\n\nI became fascinated with statistical analysis while attending the University of Southern Maine.  I pursued a career in statistics at the Cleveland Clinic and eventually moved to Richmond, Kentucky to support the mission of the Bluegrass Chemical Agent destruction Pilot Plant (BGCAPP).  I am fortunate to do work that I love every day designing studies, performing analyses, and developing reproducible programming solutions for operational support.\n\n## Programming Hobbyist\n\nProgramming in R has been a way for me to explore new solutions to problems I encounter in my work. It has also helped me develop greater knowledge of statistical concepts and communication methods.  \n\nIn time, I hope to become fluent in C# in order to leverage the strengths of R, C#, and SQL Server products.",
